# project-name:weather jouranal

# project description: simple api to get weather info from openweathermap.org and posting data to local host port 3000

### make sure you install node,express,body-parser and cors

### the server code is in server folder and the app.js and app.css is in website folder

### the get route to get data from the localhost is get_route

### I ignored this error in the console window "Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource." because the aplication work fine and when I searched the internet for this error I found that it is casuse by cors due to the settings of the browser

#### not all zip codes world wide work in the application since my account on open weathermap.org is free ex of working zip codes(36925 , 99950 , 86556)
